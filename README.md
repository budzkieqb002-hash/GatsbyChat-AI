Gatsby AI — Project Overview

Gatsby AI is an immersive, 1920s Art Deco-themed AI chatbot that lets you converse with three iconic characters from F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby: Jay Gatsby, Nick Carraway, and Daisy Buchanan — each powered by Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash model with deep persona system instructions.

Why It Was Made This project was built to explore the intersection of literature and AI — turning static fictional characters into living, breathing conversational partners. The goals were:

-Literary Immersion — Go beyond reading the novel. Experience the characters by talking to them directly, in their mannerisms.

-AI Persona Engineering — Demonstrate how carefully crafted system instructions can make an LLM convincingly embody distinct personalities — from Gatsby's theatrical charm to Daisy's breathy cynicism.

-Aesthetic-First Design — Capture the opulence and atmosphere of the Jazz Age through a rich, gold-and-black Art Deco visual identity — not just a chatbot, but a setting.
